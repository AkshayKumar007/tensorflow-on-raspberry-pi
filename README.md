# TensorFlow on Raspberry Pi

## It's officially supported!

As of TensorFlow 1.9, Python wheels for TensorFlow are being [officially supported](https://medium.com/tensorflow/tensorflow-1-9-officially-supports-the-raspberry-pi-b91669b0aa0). As such, this repository is no longer recommended for your TensorFlow on RPi needs; use the official sources!

## Pip installation

You can install the official wheel with the following commands, assuming you are using Raspbian 9:

```bash
sudo apt install libatlas-base-dev
pip3 install tensorflow
```

[Check out the official TensorFlow website for more information.](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_raspbian)

It was a fun ride! With Raspberry Pi support now official, I will no longer be looking to update this repository. I'm sorry that I wasn't able to continue maintaining the repo as much as I wanted, but it was amazing watching the community continue to thrive.
